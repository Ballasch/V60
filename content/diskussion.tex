All measurements performed correspond to what is to be expected according to theory:
Laser granulation can be clearly observed above a certain current value, before that the laser runs in LED mode. Likewise, the recording of the transmission spectrum is successful. From the straight background curve, it can be concluded that the background is successfully subtracted from the function generator. The suppression of the background using the 50/50 divider is therefore successful. 
The experiment is well suited for students to practically experience the basic properties of lasers. In addition, students need to know how to connect the required electrical devices, which is repeated in this experiment.
